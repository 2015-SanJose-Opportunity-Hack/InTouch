# InTouch
 
InTouch is a mobile app which aims to provide a way for the youth to stay "in touch" with the elderly in an easy and non-obstrusive way.
The main highlight of our app is push notifications. It sends static notifications for tasks that occur daily at a specific time and smart notifications which were based on the userâ€™s daily activities.
It collects data from the accelerometer and gyroscope and sends it to the python server. The server triggers smart notifications and/or calls to caretakers in case of huge deviation in the activity.



Our app will be helpful for the youth to stay in touch of the elderly. However, the idea is extensible to parents who want to check on their kids, nurses/caregivers who want to track the patients.
